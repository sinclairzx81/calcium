Requires plugins.\n\nIRC : Come and say hello in #awssum on Freenode. :)\n\n# AwsSum v1 - Redesign #\n\nThe initial version of AwsSum was a large install which carried many providers and services. Instead, ```AwsSum``` now\nhas a plugin architecture.\n\nTo use AwsSum, you will need to install a plugin to be able to talk to that service. This package is intended only for\nother developers to depend on, not for end-users. :)\n\n## Usage ##\n\nTo use an AwsSum plugin, you need to install the plugin you need for the relevant service. Please follow the\ndocumentation for that plugin.\n\n## Plugins ##\n\nIf you have written a plugin for AwsSum, please fork this repo and add it here:\n\n* [Amazon](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon)\n    * [IAm](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-iam/)\n    * [AutoScaling](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-autoscaling/)\n    * [IMd](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-imd/)\n    * [CloudFormation](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-cloudformation/)\n    * [ImportExport](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-importexport/)\n    * [CloudFront](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-cloudfront/)\n    * [RDS](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-rds/)\n    * [CloudSearch](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-cloudsearch/)\n    * [CloudWatch](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-cloudwatch/)\n    * [Route53](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-route53/)\n    * [DynamoDB](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-dynamodb/)\n    * [S3](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-s3/)\n    * [EC2](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-ec2/)\n    * [SES](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-ses/)\n    * [ElastiCache](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-elasticache/)\n    * [SimpleDB](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-simpledb/)\n    * [ElasticBeanstalk](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-elasticbeanstalk/)\n    * [SNS](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-sns/)\n    * [ELB](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-elb/)\n    * [SQS](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-sqs/)\n    * [EMR](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-emr/)\n    * [StorageGateway](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-storagegateway/)\n    * [FPS](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-fps/)\n    * [STS](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-sts/)\n    * [Glacier](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-glacier/)\n    * [SWF](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-swf/)\n\nComing soon:\n\n* [Amazon](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon)\n    * [RedShift](https://github.com/awssum/awssum-amazon-redshift/)\n\n## Writing a Plugin ##\n\nThe first thing to realise when writing a plugin is that each service is provided by a provider. In the case of Amazon\nS3, Amazon is the provider and S3 is the service. For Twitter, since they only provide one service, then the provider\nwould be named 'twitter' and you'd probably use the same name for the service.\n\nIn general then, you'd write two plugins with the following names:\n\n* awssum-&lt;provider&gt; - e.g. awssum-amazon, awssum-twitter\n* awssum-&lt;provider&gt;-&lt;service&gt; - e.g. awssum-amazon-s3, awssum-twitter-twitter\n\nFor other examples, you might write ```awssum-openstack```, ```awssum-openstack-nova``` and ```awssum-openstack-keystone```.\n\nOnce the provider plugin exists, new services for that provider just need the ```awssum-<provider>-<service>``` to be\nwritten. e.g. ```awssum-openstack-swift```.\n\n### peerDependencies ###\n\nPlease also note to use ```peerDependencies``` in your ```package.json``` and depend on the correct version of\nAwsSum. Your ```awssum-<provider>``` package should peer depend on AwsSum and your ```awssum-<provider>-<service>```\npackage should peer depend on your ```awssum-<provider>``` package. I hope this makes sense. :)\n\n# Author #\n\nWritten by [Andrew Chilton](http://chilts.org/) - [Blog](http://chilts.org/blog/) -\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/andychilton).\n\n# License #\n\n* [Copyright 2011-2013 Apps Attic Ltd.
